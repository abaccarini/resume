\company' goal of XXX

Currently, I am nearing completion of my PhD in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, where I specialized in secure multi-party computation (SMC) and its applications. Throughout my PhD, I have worked on a variety of different projects under the scope of classical protocol design, prototyping, and implementation, alongside developing new methodologies for evaluating information disclosure from arbitrary secure function evaluation.
My research in this space has resulted in several publications in top security conferences and recognition
